		<h2> The Imitation Game </h2>

		<p class="quote"> Can machines think?</p>

		<p>
			I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with
			definitions of the meaning of the terms "machine" and "think." The definitions might be
			framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is
			dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by
			examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the
			meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a
			statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a
			definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is
			expressed in relatively unambiguous words.<br>
			The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the
			'imitation game." It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an
			interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the
			other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other
			two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the
			end of the game he says either "X is A and Y is B" or "X is B and Y is A." The
			interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:<br>
			C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?<br>
			Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game to try and
			cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be:<br>
			"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long."<br>
			In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written,
			or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating
			between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an
			intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator.
			The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as
			"I am the woman, don't listen to him!" to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man
			can make similar remarks.<br>
			We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this
			game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as
			he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace
			our original, "Can machines think?"

		<h2>Critique of the New Problem</h2>

		<p class="quote"> In any case there is no intention to investigate here the theory of the game, 
			and it will be assumed that the best strategy is to try to provide answers that would naturally
			 be given by a man.</p> 

		<p>
			As well as asking, "What is the answer to this new form of the question," one may ask,
			"Is this new question a worthy one to investigate?" This latter question we investigate
			without further ado, thereby cutting short an infinite regress.<br>
			The new problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical
			and the intellectual capacities of a man. No engineer or chemist claims to be able to
			produce a material which is indistinguishable from the human skin. It is possible that at
			some time this might be done, but even supposing this invention available we should feel
			there was little point in trying to make a "thinking machine" more human by dressing it
			up in such artificial flesh. The form in which we have set the problem reflects this fact in
			the condition which prevents the interrogator from seeing or touching the other
			competitors, or hearing -their voices. Some other advantages of the proposed criterion
			may be shown up by specimen questions and answers. Thus:<br>
			Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.<br>
			A : Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.<br>
			Q: Add 34957 to 70764.<br>
			A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621.<br>
			Q: Do you play chess?<br>
			A: Yes.<br>
			Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your
			move. What do you play?<br>
			A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate.<br>
			The question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing almost any one of
			the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include. We do not wish to penalise the
			machine for its inability to shine in beauty competitions, nor to penalise a man for losing
			in a race against an aeroplane. The conditions of our game make these disabilities
			irrelevant. The "witnesses" can brag, if they consider it advisable, as much as they please
			about their charms, strength or heroism, but the interrogator cannot demand practical
			demonstrations.<br>
			The game may perhaps be criticised on the ground that the odds are weighted too heavily
			against the machine. If the man were to try and pretend to be the machine he would
			clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and
			inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something which ought to be
			described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does? This objection is 
			a very strong one, but at least we can say that if, nevertheless, a machine can be
			constructed to play the imitation game satisfactorily, we need not be troubled by this
			objection.<br>
			It might be urged that when playing the "imitation game" the best strategy for the
			machine may possibly be something other than imitation of the behaviour of a man. This
			may be, but I think it is unlikely that there is any great effect of this kind. In any case
			there is no intention to investigate here the theory of the game, and it will be assumed that
			the best strategy is to try to provide answers that would naturally be given by a man.<br>
