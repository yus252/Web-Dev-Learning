File Description: It is used to explain every little projects that I have done
to keep track of the process of learning website development.

#1: Pokemon Chart on 6/20/2019
I was learning HTML basics at this time. Thus, this project only applies by
HTML. But I like this project a lot since I like Pokemon!!! The main concepts
used in this project are link, image, and table.


#2: TicTacToe on 6/21/2019
This is created while I am learning CSS. I just learned how to select elements
in different ways and manipulate background and borders. There, I created a 3 by
3 table to represent the board. Then, I use CSS to highlight the border that is 
needed for this game.


#3: Photo Gallery on 6/21/2019
More style about CSS, including fonts, margin, padding, and border. I used
those simple elements to creat the layout of Photo Gallery and use Google Fonts
to make the title fancy. Pictures come from the website, Unsplash.


#4 Blog on 6/21/2019
This project mainly focuses on CSS. It is fake blog website for Turning(I just 
copied content from his book). Besides Google Fonts, I added text-align, 
letter-space, and line-height. Also, I use color of hexadecimal value to choose
more precise color. 


#5 Image Gallery on 6/22/2019
I am learning how to use Bootstrap now. Thus, this project is basically the same
idea as the project beofore, Photo Galllery. But this one is maily focus on
Bootstrap. Since the video teaching how to use Bootstrap is using Bootstrap 3, I
also use Bootstrap 3 in this project. I have used container, navigation bar,
jumbotron, grid, and thumbnail from Bootstrap. Also, I used icons from Font 
Awsome. The first two pictures are taken by me. Others are from Unsplash.


#6 Purrfect on 6/22/2019
Purrfect is a website to connect human and animals( Sounds funny, right!). This
projects combines all the tools that I have used before -- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
Google Fonts, Font Awsome, and Unsplash. New things is that I set the background
to be the picture from Unspash, add shawdow to the title, and use horizontal
line.


#7 Pattern on 6/23/2019
Pattern is website that transforms your picture to look like a certain mood. I
began to use Bootstrap 4 in this project. I tried some new things in Bootstrap
4, including display, cards, button, spacing under small, middle, and large
screens( different pixel number), and editing margin/padding directly in class,
like mt-5.

#8 Food Museum on 6/23/2019
Food Museum displays pictures of food. It can work as a gallery of different
food or a menu website. For this time, I tried more "hidden" effect of
Bootstrap. For example, the navbar is fix-top but when you scoll the page, it
changes color( a little bit of JavaScript); To make the picture's size
proportional to the page as the user drag the window to change the page's size,
I set image to be "container-fluid"; I implemented flex box to make the text and
the picture have the same height; the text will be hiddent when the window is
small and the order of the description and the picture will also change.


#9 Todo List on 6/23/2019
I am now learning JavaScript. The main focus of this small project is
"function" and "array", including alert, prompt, and forEach. Array is used to
keep track of the user's todos. Every time the user opens the page, it asks to
type one command of the four, [new], [delete], [list], and [quit].


#10 Score Keeper on 6/24/2019
Score Keeper keeps track of the scores between two players. Users can input how
many rounds they will have, resert the gaem, and add scores. I maily toggled
with addEventListener(), classList.add(), and querySelector("id).


#11 RGB Color Game on 6/24/2019
This game is the clone of the online web game of the same name. Since I was 
writing the function while playing the game to seek out JavaScript effects, the 
code is a little bit messy. It wraps up all the things that I have learned so 
far.New things: Math.random & floor and style.display in JavaScript and
transition, outline, and border radius in CSS.
